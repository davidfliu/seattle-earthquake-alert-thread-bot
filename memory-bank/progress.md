# Progress: SeattleEarthquakeAlerts Threads Bot

## What works

*   Project directory `earthquake-threads-bot` and `memory-bank` subdirectory created.
*   Core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) created with initial content based on the project plan.

## What's left to build

*   Initialize TypeScript project.
*   Set up basic CDK project structure.
*   Implement USGS data fetching and filtering logic.
*   Implement Threads API interaction logic (including OAuth token handling).
*   Implement DynamoDB state management.
*   Define AWS resources using CDK.
*   Set up CI/CD pipeline configuration.
*   Implement unit and integration tests.
*   Perform one-time manual OAuth authorization and initial token storage in Secrets Manager.

## Current status

Project setup and initial documentation are complete. Ready to begin implementing the core bot logic and infrastructure.

## Known issues

*   None at this stage.

## Evolution of project decisions

*   Initial decision to use AWS serverless components (Lambda, EventBridge, etc.) confirmed based on cost analysis and user preference.
*   Decision to use DynamoDB for state management confirmed.
*   Decision to use TypeScript and CDK confirmed.
