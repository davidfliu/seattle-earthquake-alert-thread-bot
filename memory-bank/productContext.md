# Product Context: SeattleEarthquakeAlerts Threads Bot

## Why this project exists

To provide a dedicated, automated source for earthquake alerts specifically relevant to the greater Seattle area on the Threads social media platform.

## Problems it solves

*   Lack of a centralized, automated, and geographically-filtered earthquake alert system on Threads.
*   Provides a convenient way for Seattle residents to stay informed about local seismic activity.

## How it should work

The bot should:
*   Periodically check for new earthquake data from USGS.
*   Filter this data based on predefined geographic coordinates for the Seattle area.
*   Format relevant earthquake information into concise messages suitable for Threads posts.
*   Post these messages to the SeattleEarthquakeAlerts Threads account.
*   Avoid posting duplicate alerts for the same earthquake.

## User experience goals

*   Users following the SeattleEarthquakeAlerts Threads account receive timely and relevant notifications about earthquakes in their area.
*   The information provided in the posts is clear, concise, and includes essential details like magnitude and location.
